### About me

Hi! I'm David! I like to code, play games, and code games (why didn't you read the second heading). I play Minecraft, Roblox, and Among Us, and like to code. MY development environment consists of Windows as a base, WSL on top with most of my dev tools and general Linux stuff, and more stuff I'll get to in the next sentence. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Visual Studio(https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [Roblox Studio](https://web.roblox.com/create), and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

I'm currently interested in C++, Python, Pug, and JavaScript.
